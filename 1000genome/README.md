# Execution Traces for 1000Genome Workflow

## Workflow Description

The 1000 genomes project provides a reference for human variation, having reconstructed the genomes of 2,504 individuals across 26 different populations. The test case implemented as a [Pegasus](https://pegasus.isi.edu) workflow identifies mutational overlaps using data from the 1000 genomes project in order to provide a null distribution for rigorous statistical evaluation of potential disease-related mutations.
