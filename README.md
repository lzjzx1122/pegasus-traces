# Pegasus Workflow Execution Traces

This repository contains workflow execution traces generated from
[Pegasus](http://pegasus.isi.edu) workflow executions. The traces
hosted in this repository use the
[WorkflowHub JSON format](https://github.com/workflowhub/workflow-schema)
for describing workflow executions.

#### Repository Structure

Workflow execution traces are organized into sub-folders within this
repository. Each sub-folder represents a _workflow application_, which
itself contains sub-folders for workflow executions in different
_computing platforms_.

## Summary of Workflow Execution Traces

| Application | Science Domain | Computing Platforms | Total Workflow Executions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1000Genome | Bioinformatics | 1 | 22 |
| Montage | Astronomy | 1 | 8 |
| SoyKB | Bioinformatics | 1 | 6 |
